# Turn_Based_Game_AI_Tutorial
Step by step code to create an AI player for a turn based game

This project is not intended to be the best possible AI player but rather to show practically in code how an AI player can be created for a complete knowledge turn based game.

###Part1 Basic Min Max Game Tree
This part of the project containes the a basic min max game tree for naughts & crosses

###Part2 AB Pruning Tree
This part changes the min max game tree created in part 1 into a AB Pruning Tree

###Part3 Neural Network
This part changes the evaluation function to use a neural network that was trained using back propogation
